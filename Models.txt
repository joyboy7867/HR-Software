here's your master list of models you can use with SentenceTransformer. These are models hosted on Hugging Face and directly compatible with the sentence-transformers library.

🔥 1. General-Purpose (Good Accuracy + Speed)
Model	Size	Comments
all-MiniLM-L6-v2	~80MB	Default, fast, good for small apps
all-mpnet-base-v2	~420MB	Better accuracy, ideal general-purpose model
paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2	~80MB	Good for paraphrase detection, general use
paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2	~420MB	Same as above but deeper context

🧠 2. Semantic Search / Matching Models (High Performance)
Model	Size	Description
intfloat/e5-base-v2	~440MB	🔥 Best for query-passage like JD/resume matching
intfloat/e5-small-v2	~120MB	Smaller, faster version
BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5	~400MB	Also top-tier for semantic search (requires prompt prefixing)
BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5	~120MB	Lighter, still powerful
multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1	~100MB	Good for multi-question-answer tasks (retrieval etc.)

✅ Use E5 or BGE for smart search bar + JD-to-resume ranking.

🌐 3. Multilingual Models
Model	Size	Languages	Notes
distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v2	~240MB	🌍 50+ languages	Balanced multilingual performance
paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2	~200MB	🌍 Global	Great for cross-language matching
sentence-transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1	~550MB	🌍 100+	Heavier but accurate

🧩 4. Specialty / Task-Focused Models
Model	Task	Comments
sentence-transformers/msmarco-distilbert-dot-v5	Dense Retrieval	Great for QA-type ranking
sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1	Semantic Search	Good balance of speed & quality
sentence-transformers/stsb-roberta-large	STS Benchmark	Great for sentence similarity tasks
nreimers/MiniLMv2-L12-H384-distilled-from-RoBERTa-Large	Fast & light	Custom distilled model

🛠 How to Use Any of These
